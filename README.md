# This is the official source code for INGREX: An Interactive Graph Neural Network Explanation Framework

Explanation methods used in this framework are proposed in [SCALE](https://github.com/alexbui91/SCALE) and [PGX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03075)

The project includes two components: frontend and backend. The frontend (./sc_viz) is implemented using Angular and CytoscapeJS. The backend (./web_server) uses flask as the webserver. Please checkout the README files of corresponding folders to build the web application and run the web server. Both of them need to be run.
